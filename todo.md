# TODO
- Add configuration files to change parameters. Examples:
    - episode size in millis
	- default events-to-rewards scheme
	- auto starting capture
    - default vehicle
    - teleport after episode
    - rng seed
	- ability to show / hide in-game notifications
- **[IMP]** Setup a RESTful server. Sample queries include:
	- `/episode/{nearest_epoch}`
	- `/reward/{nearest_epoch}` (using the default reward scheme)
	- `/trainer/{start|stop}`
    - `/trainer/teleport-random`
    - `/trainer/teleport/area_name`
    - `/trainer/teleport/{latitude_longitude}`
    - `/trainer/p`
	- `/trainer/configure/{prop_key}/{prop_value}`
- Add sample examples (in python) that demonstrate the process of generating datasets
- Add additional features for easy training:
    - Teleport to random road / nearest road
    - Spawn in some default vehicle
    - Lose wanted level after each episode
    - Fix vehicle after episodes
    - Teleport after being submerged
    - In-game controls for all trainer features
- Add more events
